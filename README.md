# Automated Quality Filtering for Diabetic Retinopathy Datasets
---
## Overview

This is an automated quality filtering system for diabetic retinopathy (DR) fundus image datasets.  
It addresses a critical challenge in medical AI: ensuring dataset quality for robust model training.  
Using adaptive quality thresholds and medical image-specific metrics, it systematically identifies and removes low-quality images while preserving clinically relevant data.  

All datasets used in this work are publicly available.  
The structure can be adapted as needed to accommodate other datasets.

#### Composite Quality Scoring

The final composite score integrates normalized quality metrics using a weighted combination of three quality components across 10 key image quality dimensions:
